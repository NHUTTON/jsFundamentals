// assignment operator
let r = 5;

//addition assignment operator
r += 1 // r = r + 1
console.log(r);

//subtraction assignment operator 
r -= 1 // r = r - 1
console.log(r); // 5 is the answer because JS reads from top to bottom.

//multiplication assignment operator
r *= 1; // r = r * 1
console.log(r);

//division assignment operator
r /= 2; // r = r / 2
console.log(r)

// remainder (modulus) assignment operator
r %= 2; // r = r % 2 this means that 2 goes into 2.5 once and has a raminder of .5
console.log(r)

// exponential assignment operator
r **= 1 // r = r ** 1
console.log(r)
